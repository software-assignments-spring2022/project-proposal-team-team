# Project Proposal

Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester. Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Collaboration

This proposal was written by me (Spenser Laier)

### Project title

Privacy Oriented Notes App

### What and why?

What software system would you like to build this semester, and why? Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important.

My idea is a web-based note-taking application with added privacy features. In many cases, apps used to take notes on a computer (ex. Google Docs) offer a variety
of options for formatting text, but privacy features for users typing in public places are often not a significant
concern. My app idea would combine standard text-editing functonality with privacy features, and would thus solve some of the problems/concerns raised by
using a note-taking app in situations where one must document potentially sensitive information in a public place.

### For whom?

Who will this software be for? These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users. Tell us who they are. For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not.

While people with professions geared towards writing (such as book writers or journalists) may benefit from the privacy features of the app, I believe the 
added privacy functionality would be beneficial to anyone who might otherwise have use for a note taking app. That is, people who want to quickly jot down
a new password or piece of contact information would benefit from this app and its privacy features.

### How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

There would be a user interface to allow text editing with some functionaility for text formatting. 
Ideas for privacy-oriented features include:
  -A privacy screen which can be enabled or disabled via keyboard commands or a gui button, which conceals a portion of what has already been written
on the screen. The size of the privacy screen can be modified by the user to encompass a certain number of lines, a number of words, a number of paragraphs,
etc.
  -A censor feature, which would allow particular words or pieces of highlighted text to be hidden from the screen until unhidden by the user. This could
be implemented as an extension of the censor feature, or as a separate feature which completely hides the text from the screen.
  -The ability to create and customize different privacy screens by color
  -The ability to replace the currently typed text with asterisks or some other symbol, similar to what is done
 when one types a password into a website. Again, this could be an extension of the privacy screen feature, or it could be its own
 feature entirely.
General features include:
  - The ability to edit and format text
  - The ability to download created notes
  - The ability to import created notes and edit them
 Ambitious extra features include:
  - The ability to "hide" certain portions of text within a note, so that the user can send secret messages
embedded within more public messages. For example, one might be able to enter a password to reveal a portion of hidden
text in an otherwise relatively public note/message.

### Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

I believe this project is relatively modular and adaptable in nature. The text editor implementation can be simplified if features related to formatting
prove to be too difficult to implement; Similarly, the privacy features can also be simplified or modified according to the difficulty of implementation. As the
list of fully implemented features increases, the list of new features that can be added also increases since privacy itself is something that can be continuously
improved and expanded upon.

## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
