# Project Proposal

Write a proposal for a software product you would like to pursue for the majority of the semester. Make it obvious, interesting, and make the need for it sound convincing.

## Collaboration

This proposal was written by me (Spenser Laier)

### Project title

Privacy Oriented Notes App

### What and why?

My idea is a web-based note-taking application with added privacy features. In many cases, apps used to take notes on a computer (ex. Google Docs) offer a variety
of options for formatting text, but privacy features for users typing in public places are often not a significant
concern. My app idea would combine standard text-editing functonality with privacy features, and would thus solve some of the problems/concerns raised by
using a note-taking app in situations where one must document potentially sensitive information in a public place.

### For whom?


While people with professions geared towards writing (such as book writers or journalists) may benefit from the privacy features of the app, I believe the 
added privacy functionality would be beneficial to anyone who might otherwise have use for a note taking app. That is, people who want to quickly jot down
a new password or piece of contact information would benefit from this app and its privacy features.

### How?

There would be a user interface to allow text editing with some functionaility for text formatting. 
Ideas for privacy-oriented features include:
- A privacy screen which can be enabled or disabled via keyboard commands or a gui button, 
  which conceals a portion of what has already been written on the screen. The size of the privacy screen 
  can be modified by the user to encompass a certain number of lines, a number of words, a 
  number of paragraphs,etc.
- A censor feature, which would allow particular words or pieces of highlighted text to be hidden from the screen until unhidden by the user. This could be implemented as an extension of the censor 
  feature, or as a separate feature which completely hides the text from the screen.
- The ability to create and customize different privacy screens by color
- The ability to replace the currently typed text with asterisks or some other symbol, similar to what is done
 when one types a password into a website. Again, this could be an extension of the privacy screen feature, or it could be its own
 feature entirely.
General features include:
- The ability to edit and format text
- The ability to download created notes
- The ability to import created notes and edit them
Ambitious extra features include:
- The ability to "hide" certain portions of text within a note, so that the user can send secret messages 
  embedded within more public messages. For example, one might be able to enter a password to reveal a portion of hidden
  text in an otherwise relatively public note/message.

### Scope

I believe this project is relatively modular and adaptable in nature. The text editor implementation can be simplified if features related to formatting
prove to be too difficult to implement; Similarly, the privacy features can also be simplified or modified according to the difficulty of implementation. As the
list of fully implemented features increases, the list of new features that can be added also increases since privacy itself is something that can be continuously
improved and expanded upon.
